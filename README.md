## CI/CD Overview

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are crucial practices in modern software development that help streamline the development process and enhance collaboration among team members.

### Continuous Integration (CI)
CI is a development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository. This process is often automated with the help of tools that run tests and validate code quality. The benefits of CI in the Portfolio Website project include:
- **Frequent Code Integration:** Developers can integrate changes multiple times a day, which helps identify integration issues early.
- **Automated Testing:** With CI, automated tests are run against each integration, ensuring that new changes do not break existing functionality.

### Continuous Deployment (CD)
CD extends CI by automating the deployment of code changes to production. In the context of the Portfolio Website, CD ensures that the latest version of the website is always available to users without manual intervention. Key aspects of CD include:
- **Automated Deployment:** Once code passes all tests, it is automatically deployed to the production environment, allowing for rapid updates.
- **Feedback Loops:** Continuous monitoring and feedback mechanisms ensure that any issues in production can be quickly addressed.

In conclusion, implementing CI/CD in the Portfolio Website project not only improves the efficiency of the development process but also enhances the reliability and quality of the application, ensuring a better experience for users.
